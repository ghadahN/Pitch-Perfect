# Pitch-Perfect
It is an iPhone app that records a conversation with you and a friend and plays it back with different audio effects!
- The app contains two pages of content (one each for recording and playing audio), and uses `UINavigationController` to navigate between these two scenes.
- The second scene of the app contains the following buttons for audio effects: Snail (slow), Rabbit (fast), Chipmunk (high pitch), Darth Vader (low pitch), Echo and Reverb. All six buttons work properly to play the associated sounds.
